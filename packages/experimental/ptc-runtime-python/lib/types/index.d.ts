 * boundary: model code has bash-equivalent trust, contained by a tempdir-only environment,
 * RLIMIT_CPU + RLIMIT_AS, wall-clock timeout, and SIGTERM→grace→SIGKILL on the process group.
 *
 * The package also owns the versionless fd-3 wire protocol itself; its host-side codec and
 * hostile-frame validators are re-exported so every consumer of the wire shares one vocabulary.
