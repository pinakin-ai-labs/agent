 * mid-turn folds as a balanced transcript. Backend failures propagate
 * unmapped — each caller owns its error taxonomy.
 * @param persistence - the mounted persistence service.
 * @param sessionId - the stored session to read.
 * @param signal - optional cancellation for the open and read work.
 * @returns an adoptable seed in a caller-owned outer array, ready for in-place Session restoration.
