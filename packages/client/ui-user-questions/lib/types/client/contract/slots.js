 * Narrow a request to a renderable plan review, or return undefined to leave it

 *
 * The card is one decision over one plan, and it claims a request only when it
 * can send every answer that request allows — an intent changes the layout,
 * never which answers are reachable. So the batch must be a single question
 * that declares the intent, carries the plan as its detail, offers the approve
 * label the intent names, and is a binary single choice: at most one option
 * besides approve, and not multi-select. A third option or a multi-select batch
 * has answers two buttons cannot express, so the generic flow keeps it — as it
 * keeps any request whose intent the asker's own service would have rejected,
 * because the client sits downstream of a wire boundary and every request must
 * stay answerable.
 *
 * @param questions - the request's whole question batch.
 * @returns The narrowed review, or undefined when the generic flow owns it.
