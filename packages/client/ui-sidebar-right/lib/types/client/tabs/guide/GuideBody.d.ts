/**
 * The guide tab's body: a chain host, and the guide it falls back to.
 *
 * The chain is the replacement seam. A product with its own idea of what an
 * empty sidebar should say registers into `sidebar.right.tab.guide`, and its entry
 * takes the whole body; with no entry, or with every entry declining, the guide
 * below renders. The shipped guide is the owner's fallback rather than a chain
 * entry of its own, so there is always exactly one body and the shipped one
 * cannot be outvoted by accident.
 *
 * The shipped guide is a muted compass over the entry capsules every
 * registered type contributed, centred in the body, and nothing else — no
 * heading, as a browser start page shows its doors without a caption. While
 * at most four entries are listed, a capsule with a description shows it
 * under the title; a longer list drops every description to stay light.
 * Picking one opens that type as a page
 * in this tab's place, so the guide is a doorway rather than a page that stays
 * open.
