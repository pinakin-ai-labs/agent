/**
 * Browser half: fill the frame's right column with the panel, put the expand
 * button in the conversation header, and own the seats a tab type registers
 * into.
 *
 * Two seats share one session-scoped store, which the slot runtime allows
 * because both are session-scoped (a handle may not span scopes). The panel seat
 * in the frame draws the surface normally or fullscreen, retaining the track
 * on wide viewports; the header's corner seat draws the way back in
 * while the panel is hidden. The store is the layout's only source of truth; the docking
 * kit's pure planners compute every change and the store records them, one
 * history entry per intent.
 *
 * The frame is a base package and never injects this one. What it needs —
 * whether the panel is shown and whether it wants a track — arrives through its
 * own `ctx.layout` action face, reported by the seat that knows both facts.
 *
 * Tab types register in two stages: the type itself into `ctx.sidebarRightTabs`,
 * its body into the keyed `sidebar.right.pane.tab` seat under the same kind. The
 * guide registers through those stages unmodified, exactly as a type shipped
 * from another package does — `ui-sidebar-documentpreview` is the live proof.
