/**
 * A docking layout kit: a split tree of tabbed panes with invertible operations,
 * and the React components that render and drive it.
 *
 * Two layers, and the boundary between them is the point of the package. The
 * engine (`applyOp`, `Sequencer`, `DockController`) is pure TypeScript with no
 * React, no DOM, and no host concepts; replaying a recorded sequence over the
 * same initial state reproduces the same tree, because every operation carries
 * the ids it creates. The components render a layout snapshot and report settled
 * intents — one per gesture, never a drag frame — so the embedder's sequence
 * stays the single source of truth.
 *
 * Nothing host-specific lives here: rendered strings arrive as `DockLabels`, tab
 * bodies as a `TabRenderer`, and a tab's `kind` is an opaque string this kit
 * never interprets.
 *
 * @module
