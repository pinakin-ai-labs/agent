/**
 * Per-session sandbox-mode override: the session log as the store. A runtime
 * switch (a UI policy control or test scenario) is recorded as one
 * `sandbox/mode` event on the session it applies to;
 * `effective = projection state ?? the deployment default`, so an override
 * survives restart by replay, two sessions can never see each other's state,
 * and there is no external config store. The event is log-only (the
 * `approval/*` precedent): the policy owner projects the fold into each model
 * request, while enforcing tools report operation-specific boundary markers.
 * EXECUTION honors the same fold through `ctx.sandboxPolicy.resolve()` — it
 * stamps the mode together with the calling session's workspace root onto each
 * capability call, weakest-precedence beneath an escalation grant.
 *
 * The override is policy state shared by every enforcing family (bash and
 * filesystem alike), so it lives here in the policy package rather than in any
 * one capability's seam.
